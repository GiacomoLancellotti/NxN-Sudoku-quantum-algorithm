# NxN-Sudoku-quantum-algorithm

In this work is presented an algorithm for solving NxN Sudoku games using the Grover's quantum approach.

The code is related to a 2x2 Sudoku but its generalization for the NxN case is straightforward.

The whole algorithm is implemented using the SDK Quiskit.

All technical information are contained in the paper in this repository.
